# EyeBreak - Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Breaks Wait for You

- **A break no longer ends itself** - The countdown reaches zero, the break is counted, and the screen stays up. Your next work interval starts when you dismiss it, so a break you were not present for cannot pass as one you took
- **A completion state, not the break screen with a new button** - A checkmark replaces the countdown, the title reads "Break Complete", and one button reads "Back to Work"
- **⎋, the button, or ⌃⌥⌘⎋ dismisses it** - The keyboard stays held until you do
- **The next interval is a full one** - However long you waited, and the break is counted once, when it ended, not when you came back
- **Sleep, screen lock and going idle leave it alone** - The break is already banked; there is nothing left for them to pause
- **The watchdog covers the wait** - It releases the keyboard on its own after the break plus 2 minutes plus 10 seconds, and the overlay keeps waiting for a click
- **All three break styles wait** - The Floating Window panel waits too, and a click is the only way out of that one
- **Turn it off with "Wait for me to dismiss the break"** - In Settings > Break Style. Off, breaks end themselves exactly as they used to

#### Breaks Hold the Keyboard

- **Blur Screen and Eye Exercise now hold the keyboard** - For the length of the break, ⌘Tab, ⌘Q, ⌘H and the global hotkeys other apps have registered no longer reach past the overlay. EyeBreak's own shortcuts are held too, since starting a second break during one means nothing
- **Two ways out, each working on its own:**
  - **⎋** - Ends the break early, as before
  - **⌃⌥⌘⎋** - Releases the keyboard and ends the break, if anything goes wrong
- **⌘⌥⎋ is passed through** - Force Quit still opens, though it opens behind the overlay, so it is only usable once the break has ended
- **A watchdog releases the keyboard regardless** - It is set when the break starts, for the break's length plus 10 seconds, and reads no break state, so it fires even if something else has gone wrong

### Fixed

#### Floating Window Breaks Counted Twice

- **One break, one credit** - The Floating Window style ran a clock of its own alongside the timer's, and both ended the break. Every break in that style banked two completions and two lots of break time, and restarted the work interval a second into it

#### The Break Overlay Is Modal Again

- **ESC ends the break** - It used to reach the app underneath instead, because EyeBreak never came to the front and its ESC handler only sees events macOS has already routed to it
- **ESC works without a click first** - Bringing EyeBreak to the front is a request macOS can refuse, and when it did, ESC went nowhere until a click on the overlay. The keyboard hold now ends the break on ESC itself, whichever app has focus. Without the Accessibility grant there is no keyboard hold, and ESC still needs EyeBreak to be frontmost
- **Skipping takes one click** - The first click was spent bringing EyeBreak forward, so a skip needed two
- **Skip is a button** - With the first click no longer swallowed, click-anywhere-to-skip would have ended a break on any stray click
- **Focus returns to the app you were using** - Every way out of a break hands it back: the timer running out, ESC, Skip, and Stop or Pause from the menu
- **Stop or Pause during a break takes the overlay down** - It used to stay on screen while the timer had already moved on, which now would trap you behind a screen that ignores both ESC and Skip
- **Pausing a break no longer loses it** - Smart Schedule and the idle detector both pause during a break, and a long enough break trips the idle threshold on its own. The overlay kept its own clock, so the break ended behind the scenes and the rest of it was spent looking at your desktop — and it was still credited as completed

#### Every Display Is Covered

- **The break covers all your screens** - It used to cover only the one holding the pointer, leaving every other display visible and clickable. A break that covers one of three displays is not a break
- **Every screen shows the same countdown** - One clock drives them all, so they cannot drift apart, and the eye exercise points the same way on each
- **Plugging a display in mid-break covers it** - Unplugging one does not end the break, and neither rebuilds the overlay from the start: the time left carries over
- **VoiceOver lands on one overlay** - The screen you were working on, rather than every screen racing to claim it

#### Settings No Longer Burns CPU

- **An open Settings window used to cost about a third of a core** - With the timer idle and nothing on screen moving. Four animations in Settings had no end condition, so each one held the AppKit display cycle open every frame for as long as the window was open
- **The Active Timers card no longer animates forever** - Its header icon ran a symbol pulse with no `isActive:` gate. The card also ran a once-a-second ticker that wrote a value nothing read
- **The status banner no longer pulses** - Its status dot and status icon both animated without end whenever the timer was running. The countdown text next to them still updates every second, so the banner still reads as live
- **The two "Show ... Now" buttons on the Breaks tab no longer pulse** - Same bug, on a tab the measurements below do not cover
- **Measured** on an M4 Max, Release build, Settings open on the General tab, twelve 5-second `top` samples after a 10-second settle:

  | Timer | Before | After |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Idle | 37.0% | 0.0% |
  | Running | 38.3% | 13.5% |

  The 13.5% that remains is Settings re-rendering for the once-a-second countdown, which is real work rather than an animation

### Known Limitations

- **Needs Accessibility permission** - macOS resets this grant every time EyeBreak updates. Without it, breaks still cover every display and still end on ⎋, but shortcuts in other apps keep working during a break. Settings and the README both say which state you are in
- **Secure Event Input** - While a password field has focus, macOS delivers no keyboard event to any app, so a break cannot hold the keyboard for as long as that field is focused
