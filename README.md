## 🌟 The 20-20-20 Rule

Digital eye strain affects millions of people who spend hours in front of screens. The **20-20-20 rule** is a simple, scientifically-backed method to reduce eye fatigue:

> **Every 20 minutes** of screen time  
> Look at something **20 feet** away (about 6 meters)  
> For **20 seconds**

This gives your eye muscles a chance to relax and reduces the risk of eye strain, headaches, dry eyes, and neck pain.

#### During a break

Blur Screen and Eye Exercise cover every display and hold the keyboard for the
length of the break, so shortcuts in other apps — and EyeBreak's own — stay
quiet until it ends. Three keys still get through:

- **⎋** - End the break early
- **⌃⌥⌘⎋** - Release the keyboard and end the break, if anything goes wrong
- **⌘⌥⎋** - Force Quit, which is passed through but opens behind the overlay, so
  it is only usable once the break has ended

Holding the keyboard needs Accessibility permission. macOS resets that grant on
every EyeBreak update, so if breaks stop holding the keyboard after an update,
re-enable EyeBreak under Accessibility. Breaks still cover every display and
still end on **⎋** either way.

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS**: 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later (for building from source)
- **Swift**: 5.9+

## 🚀 Installation

### Download the App (Recommended) ⭐️

1. **[Download EyeBreak-v2.3.0.dmg](https://github.com/cheat2001/eyebreak/releases/latest)**
2. **Remove quarantine** (required for unsigned apps):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   xattr -cr EyeBreak-v2.3.0.dmg
   ```
3. **Open** the DMG file
4. **Drag** `EyeBreak.app` to your `Applications` folder
5. **Launch**:
   ```bash
   open /Applications/EyeBreak.app
   ```
6. Look for the **eye icon 👁️** in your menu bar!

> **⚠️ Why the terminal command?** The app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year).  
> macOS blocks unsigned downloads, so you must remove the quarantine flag first.

### Quick One-Line Install

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/cheat2001/eyebreak/releases/download/v2.3.0/EyeBreak-v2.3.0.dmg -o ~/Downloads/EyeBreak.dmg && xattr -cr ~/Downloads/EyeBreak.dmg && open ~/Downloads/EyeBreak.dmg
